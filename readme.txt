BruteGuard is a cloud powered brute force attack prevention plugin. We leverage the power of millions of WordPress sites to identify and block malicious IPs.

== Description ==

=== Botnets and other malicious scripts attack millions of websites each and every day ===
BruteGuard is a brute force attack prevention plugin that guards you against botnets by connecting its users to track failed login attempts across all WordPress installations that use the plugin. Once you activate BruteGuard you become part of a inter-connected protection layer against botnet attacks.
