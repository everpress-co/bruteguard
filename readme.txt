BruteGuard is a cloud powered brute force attack prevention plugin. We leverage the power of millions of WordPress sites to identify and block malicious IPs.

== Description ==

BruteGuard tracks failed login attempts across all installations. If an IP has too many failed attempts in a certain period of time the plugin blocks it from all sites where BruteGuard is installed. The plugin checks against our global database of malicious IPs to make sure that all sites running BruteGuard are protected against brute force attacks.

By utilizing BruteGuard you are protected against traditional brute force attacks and distributed brute force attacks that use multiple locations.

== Installation ==

Upload the BruteGuard plugin to your WordPress site, activate it, then generate an API key.
Youâ€™re all set!
